FEATURE 1:
python3 main.py --inspect

Input Signature:
    1. ticker symbol (string)
    2. year of investment (int64)
    3. month of investment (int64)
    4. query_stat (string, "Open", "Close", "Adjusted Close", "Low", "High")

Output Signature
    1. The relevant metric (query_stat) of a stock (ticker symbol) at a certain point in time (month and year of investment)

- Upon execution, the Python program will prompt argument on its own to prevent any formatting error. Given the complexity of the required input.

Find the earliest and latest record dates of a stock.

Input Signature:
    1. ticker symbol (string)

Output Signature:
    1. list [earliest year in record, earliest month in record]
    2. list [latest year in record, latest month in record]

----------------------------

FEATURE 3:
python3 main.py --stock_ROI

Input Signature:
    1. ticker symbol (string)
    2. year of investment (int64); default = earliest date in the dataset
    3. month of investment (int64); default = earliest date in the dataset
    4. year of divestment (int64); default = latest date in the dataset
    5. month of divestment (int64); default = latest date in the dataset
    6. buying price (string, "Open", "Close", "Adjusted Close", "Low", "High"); default = "Open"
    7. selling price (string, "Open", "Close", "Adjusted Close", "Low", "High"); default = "Close"

Output Signature:
    1. The calculated return on investment in percentage (float data format), for the specified stock.

- Upon execution, the Python program will prompt argument on its own to prevent any formatting error. Given the complexity of the required input.
