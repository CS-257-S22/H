    1. ticker symbol (string)
    2. year of investment (int64)
    3. month of investment (int64)
    4. query_stat (string, "Open", "Close", "Adjusted Close", "Low", "High")

Output Signature
    1. The relevant metric (query_stat) of a stock (ticker symbol) at a certain point in time (month and year of investment)
